This project is an extension of the https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-data-jpa[Spring Data JPA] project to allow access to entity revisions managed by Hibernate Envers.The sources mostly originate from a contribution of Philipp Hügelmeyer https://github.com/hygl[@hygl].

The core feature of the module consists of an implementation of the `RevisionRepository` of Spring Data Commons.

== Code of Conduct

This project is governed by the https://github.com/spring-projects/.github/blob/e3cc2ff230d8f1dca06535aa6b5a4a23815861d4/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md[Spring Code of Conduct]. By participating, you are expected to uphold this code of conduct. Please report unacceptable behavior to spring-code-of-conduct@pivotal.io.

== Getting Started

[source,java]
----
public interface RevisionRepository<T, ID extends Serializable, N extends Number & Comparable<N>> {

	Revision<N, T> findLastChangeRevision(ID id);

	Revisions<N, T> findRevisions(ID id);

	Page<Revision<N, T>> findRevisions(ID id, Pageable pageable);
}
----

You can pull in this functionality to your repositories by simply additionally extending the interface just mentioned:

[source,java]
----
interface PersonRepository extends RevisionRepository<Person, Long, Integer>, CrudRepository<Person, Long> {

	// Your query methods go here
}
----

To activate the Spring Data Envers repositories, use the Spring Data Envers' `EnableEnversRepositories` annotation:

[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableEnversRepositories
public class ApplicationConfiguration {

	// Your configuration beans

}
----

or use the Spring Data JPA repositories namespace element's `factory-class` attribute, in case of XML configuration:

[source,xml]
----
<jpa:repositories base-package="com.acme.repositories"
                  factory-class="….EnversRevisionRepositoryFactoryBean" />
----

=== Maven configuration

Add the Maven dependency:

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-envers</artifactId>
  <version>${version}.RELEASE</version>
</dependency>
----

If you'd rather like the latest snapshots of the upcoming major version, use our Maven snapshot repository and declare the appropriate dependency version.

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.data</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-data-envers</artifactId>
  <version>${version}.BUILD-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>

<repository>
  <id>spring-libs-snapshot</id>
  <name>Spring Snapshot Repository</name>
  <url>https://repo.spring.io/libs-snapshot</url>
</repository>

== Getting Help

Having trouble with Spring Data? We’d love to help!

* Check the
https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/envers/docs/current/reference/html/[reference documentation], and https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/envers/docs/current/api/[Javadocs].
* Learn the Spring basics – Spring Data builds on Spring Framework, check the https://spring.io[spring.io] web-site for a wealth of reference documentation.
If you are just starting out with Spring, try one of the https://spring.io/guides[guides].
* Ask a question - we monitor https://stackoverflow.com[stackoverflow.com] for questions tagged with https://stackoverflow.com/tags/spring-data-envers[`spring-data-envers`].
You can also chat with the community on https://gitter.im/spring-projects/spring-data[Gitter].
* Report bugs with Spring Data envers at https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-envers/issues[github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-envers/issues].

== Reporting Issues

Spring Data uses GitHub as issue tracking system to record bugs and feature requests. If you want to raise an issue, please follow the recommendations below:

* Before you log a bug, please search the
https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-envers/issues[issue tracker] to see if someone has already reported the problem.
* If the issue doesn’t already exist, https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-data-envers/issues/new[create a new issue].
* Please provide as much information as possible with the issue report, we like to know the version of Spring Data that you are using and JVM version.
* If you need to paste code, or include a stack trace use Markdown +++```+++ escapes before and after your text.
* If possible try to create a test-case or project that replicates the issue. Attach a link to your code or a compressed file containing your code.

== Building from Source

You don’t need to build from source to use Spring Data (binaries in https://repo.spring.io[repo.spring.io]), but if you want to try out the latest and greatest, Spring Data can be easily built with the https://github.com/takari/maven-wrapper[maven wrapper].
You also need JDK 1.8.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install
----

If you want to build with the regular `mvn` command, you will need https://maven.apache.org/run-maven/index.html[Maven v3.5.0 or above].

_Also see link:CONTRIBUTING.adoc[CONTRIBUTING.adoc] if you wish to submit pull requests, and in particular please sign the https://cla.pivotal.io/sign/spring[Contributor’s Agreement] before your first non-trivial change._

=== Building reference documentation

Building the documentation builds also the project without running tests.

[source,bash]
----
 $ ./mvnw clean install -Pdistribute
----

The generated documentation is available from `target/site/reference/html/index.html`.
